# Ticket Champ

## Making tickets cheaper one seat at a time

#### Our app is a ticket price aggregator that compares the price of tickets for events of all types from different ticket selling vendors Seatgeek and Ticketmaster (Kayak/Orbitz for events). Users will be able to make search queries based on events they would like to attend and the location, and would be able to pick the best vendor service for their needs. Our website will fetch from the Seatgeek and TicketMaster APIs, and will be able to store recent searches and render those events and prices on the page as “Trending Searches”.
